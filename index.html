          <p>Hello and welcome to the remote agile planner. Created because all other tools sucked.</p>
          <p>Design goals were to be fast, require no log in, keep tongue in cheek, and be feature minimal.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>I wanna get going!</h3>
          <p>Yep just type in any url to kick off a room. Like __/my-room-ok or _/1337-p14nr. So that's good.</p>
        <div>
          <h3>Yep we've got BUGS!</h3>
          <p>TODO: This currently works in CHROME and FIREFOX. No idea why Safari is naughty, or IE for that matter.</p>
          <p>TODO: Swapping rooms requires a hard browser reload. This is because rooms are actually just namespaces so there's a slight borking of state.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Version</h3>
          <p>We measure versions in the days we've spent on this. This is day 2</p>

          <h3>FAQ</h3>
          <p>
            <em>Can I save a session so we can come back to estimates?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Both of my coworkers are called Dave. Can we create permanent usernames to ensure they're unique?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>We don't use agile - can we still use the tool?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Can we have company specific rooms like '/facebook' that have passwords to stop spies, the NSA or Chinese leet haxxors reading our estimates and therefore compromising the integrity of our backlogs?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Will you ever do any integrations with Jira or Trello. Slack is pretty cool. People use that now right? What ever happened to ICQ. Anyway do you think that's possible?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Isn't it a good idea to track estimates over time, you know report on it so management feel like they've done something crediable rather than procrastinate about how they don't actually create anything? So can you add reporting?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Wouldn't it be great if the user story was shown in like the title or something?</em>
            <strong>No.</strong>
